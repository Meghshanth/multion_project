# MultiOn Interview Project

Goal: Create an end-to-end AI application that takes in an input image screenshot and translates that to browser actions to complete a task using the MultiOn API.

Files in lib:
- main.dart: Flutter Application
- MultiOn backend - InstructBlip-Vicuna-7b and OpenAI models.ipynb: Complete backend, information generation from instructblip-vicuna-7b and passed to OpenAi API then passed prompt generated by OpenAI to MultiOn API.
## Getting Started

Using:
- Flutter App (Primarily Android) (Language: Dart)
- Firebase Database (Used for app messaging view and storage)
- [InstructBlip-Vicuna-7b (Visual Language Model)] (https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/instructblip-vicuna-7b)
- [OpenAi API] (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)
- [MultiOn API] (https://docs.multion.ai/api-reference/sessions/create)

## Future Development

- Generate more accurate prompts to pass to the MultiOn API by training or fine-tuning.
